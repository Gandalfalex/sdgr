# Demonstrate Time Series Analytics Software at Trade Show
## Background
You are responsible for demonstrating your company's new time series analytics software at a trade show. The
software uses Kafka consumers to stream in real-time data from sensors and other sources, providing valuable
insights into operations. However, your current setup does not allow you to demonstate complex patterns and behaviours. 
This is why you prepared data beforehand.


Your goal is to successfully demonstrate the software to potential customers and convince them to buy your
company's product. 

But how are you going to achieve this?

You found the SUS-Software, its a small webapp that lets you create your own sensor simulation projects and even has the ability to let you generate synthetic data of your own choosing.


## Task 1:
[login here](http://t123abcdefg.mooo.com/)

The only thing you have to do is:

1. get your  data (it will be in the folder)
2. set up an account (use arbitrary values, but the email should follow the ususal conventions)
4. you've decided to use machine learning for your task, since you're not interessted in forecasting, you'll choose a generative adverserial network.
5. create a new training configuration, give it a reasonable name and add a description, and add your custom configurations.
6. start training the model. While its training, take another look arround the software and see if you find something interessting.
7. after the training is finished, build your own project with one track.
   1. start with a small sleep cycle (10s)
   2. open your machine learning model
   3. create another sleep cycle (10s)
   4. create a linear ascend
8. start sending your data


## Task 2:

The only thing you have to do is:

1. get your  data (it will be in the folder)
2. set up an account (use arbitrary values, but the email should follow the ususal conventions)
4. you've decided to use time series analysis for your task, choose the SSA algorithm.
5. create a new training configuration, give it a reasonable name and add a description, and add your custom configurations.
6. add you build your own project with one track.
   1. start with a small sleep cycle (10s)
   2. open your time series analysis model
   3. create another sleep cycle (10s)
   4. create a linear ascend
7. start sending your data
