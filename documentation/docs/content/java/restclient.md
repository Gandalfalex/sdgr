## RestClient Overview

### Purpose and Integration
- **Role**: The RestClient is crucial for communication with the Django API, specifically in the context of a Spring-based application.
- **Key Functionality**: It enables data exchange, especially for synthetic data generation, between the Spring framework and Django components.

### Handling JWT for Django API
- **Challenge**: Managing and creating JWTs tailored to user contexts poses a significant challenge.
- **Solution**: The RestClient overcomes this by generating new JWTs for secure and personalized Django API interactions.

### Division of Responsibilities
- **Spring's Role**: Manages entities like projects, tracks, and datasets within the application.
- **Django's Role**: Handles synthetic data generation. The RestClient builds requests to retrieve this data from Django for subsequent processing or transmission.

### Real-Time Application Considerations
- **Failsafe Methods**: Techniques like Retry and Jitter are intentionally excluded.
- **Reasoning**: In real-time applications, such methods could impede performance by increasing network load, affecting responsiveness and efficiency.

## RestClientService Functionality

### Understanding RestClientService
`RestClientService` is a common component in applications that need external data integration, particularly for Machine Learning (ML) and Time Series Analysis (TSA).

### Purpose of RestClientService
Its primary role is to act as a bridge for data exchange between the application and an external Django server, crucial for accessing complex data types remotely.

### Key Features
1. **ML Data Retrieval**: Requests and retrieves ML data based on specific model IDs.
2. **TSA Data Acquisition**: Fetches TSA data essential for temporal data analysis.
3. **Forecasting Based on ML Data**: Predicts future trends using existing ML data, aiding in predictive analysis.

### Operational Mechanism
- Operates by sending requests to a Django server with parameters like model IDs and authorization tokens.
- Processes server responses to deliver the requested data to the application for further use.
