### Architecture

Implementation of Hexagonal Architecture

Core Concept: The application has implemented the Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters architecture.

Interface-Driven Communication: This architecture emphasizes communication through interfaces, enhancing the application's ability to manage dependencies effectively.


Distinct Layered Structure

1. Adapter Layer:
    - Purpose: Handles incoming and outgoing data, including interactions with REST controllers, websockets, and database communications.
    - Interface Exposure: Adapters expose only interfaces to the external world, encapsulating their internal logic.
    - Role in Data Flow: Serves as the entry and exit points for data, acting as a bridge between external agents and the application core.

2. Service Layer:
    - Dependency Injection: Relies solely on interface injection, with Spring managing the injection of required implementations.
    - Separation from Other Layers: Maintains complete isolation from other architectural layers, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
    - Flexibility and Strict Data Flow: Offers greater flexibility in application operation and enforces a more controlled data flow.
    - Simplified Code Management: Compared to previous versions where each path had its own package, the new structure is more streamlined and organized, with strict control over component interactions.


3. Port Layer
    - Faciliates communication with service layer

Benefits of the Hexagonal Architecture:
Improved Dependency Injection: The architecture enhances the application's ability to manage dependencies through inversion of control.

Easier Component Exchange: Components can be easily replaced as long as they adhere to the defined interfaces, facilitating scalability and maintainability.

Adherence to Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The application aligns with the DIP, ensuring that higher-level modules do not depend on lower-level modules but rather on abstractions. This principle promotes a more robust, testable, and scalable application structure.
