# Spring AOP User Attachment and Validation

This article describes an implementation of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in a Spring application for the purpose of handling user authentication using JWT tokens, and for attaching user details to an HTTP request. 

## Class overview:

- `UserAspect`: Primary aspect class to manage user authentication and attachment.
- `AttachUser`: Annotation used for marking methods that need user attachment.


### UserAspect

The `UserAspect` is the main class where AOP is implemented. The `@Aspect` and `@Component` annotations make this class an aspect and allow it to be auto-discovered by Spring's classpath scanning.

The `UserAspect` is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Extracting the user data from JSON Web Token (JWT) from the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.
2. Authenticating the user and attaching the user data to the current HTTP request.
3. If the JWT does not exist or the user does not correspond to the token, the `InvalidCredentialException` is thrown.
4. Handling thread-specific data by storing the user details in a `ThreadLocal` variable. This ensures that each individual request thread has its own unique user data.

### AttachUser

The `AttachUser` is a custom annotation used for tagging the methods where user information is required. This is detected at runtime by the JVM due to the `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` annotation.

The purpose of this annotation is to trigger the invocation of `attachUser` method within the `UserAspect` class before the method execution.
