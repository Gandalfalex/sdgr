## Spring Security

### Goal:
The goal of using spring security is to limit user access, ecspecially in a multi user environment.
Data is mapped to a user, therefor certain data access is restricted to one specific user, while other components are available to all.



### Partial CORS and CSRF Configuration
- Integration with Traefik: The Spring Security setup includes a partial configuration for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, implemented in combination with Traefik, a popular cloud-native edge router.
- Enhanced Security: This configuration is crucial for securing the application against common web vulnerabilities, especially in a microservices architecture.

### Authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- JWT Explained: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In the context of web security, JWTs are used for authentication and information exchange, where the token's payload contains the claims and the server can verify and trust the source without needing to query the database.
- Benefits: JWT offers a stateless solution to authentication, which is well-suited for scalable web applications.

### Current Authentication Setup
- No External Provider: The current implementation does not utilize external authentication providers like OAuth.
- Key Management: The key for JWT is managed as part of the application's properties, ensuring secure handling and easy configuration management.
