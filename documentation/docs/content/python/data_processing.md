## Data Processing
Overview

Proper data preparation is crucial for effective machine learning training. This process involves ensuring that each data series is of the same length, preferably normalized, and reducing data volume to enhance training performance. It also includes a method to store the parameters necessary for reconstructing the original data dimensions.

### Process Components
1. Normalization:
    - Purpose: To scale data to a standard range, 0 to 1, which helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process.
    - Method: Apply a normalization technique (like Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization) to each training data series.
2. Length Uniformity:
    - Purpose: To ensure that all data series used for training are of the same length, which is necessary for many machine learning algorithms.
    - Method: interpolate data series to achieve uniform length across all datasets.
3. Data Reduction:
    - Purpose: To reduce the amount of data to be processed, which can decrease training time and computational cost. This step may involve a trade-off with the loss of some information.  
    - Method: Apply data reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), downsampling, or feature selection.
4. Parameter Storage:
    - Purpose: To store the parameters used during data preparation, which is crucial for reconstructing the original dimensions of the data for post-analysis or interpretability.
    - Method: Maintain a separate database or data structure to record parameters like scaling factors, padding lengths, and feature selection criteria.


## Time Series Gap Detection and Removal Process

This process involves two main steps:

- Gap Detection: Determines whether there are gaps in the provided time series data.
- Gap Removal: If gaps are detected, this step removes the gaps using imputation or other specified methods.

### Step 1: Gap Detection
- Function: contains_gaps(time_stamps_normalized)
- Purpose: To check if there are any gaps in the time series data.
- Parameters:
    - time_stamps_normalized: A list of numpy arrays, each representing normalized timestamps for a time series dataset.
- Returns: True if gaps are detected, False otherwise.

### Step 2: Gap Removal
This step is only executed if contains_gaps returns True.

- Function: remove_gaps_if_existing(original_data, time_data, imputation_function)
- Purpose: To remove gaps in the time series data.
- Parameters:
    - original_data: List of numpy arrays, each array representing a set of original data points in the time series.
    - time_data: List of numpy arrays, each array representing time data corresponding to the original data points.
    - imputation_function: A function that imputes missing values in the data. This function is applied to small gaps.
- Returns: A tuple containing:
    - Filled data array with gaps handled.
    - Array indicating positions of large gaps (if any).
    - Integer indicating the length of the data.

Check for Gaps:

Invoke contains_gaps(time_stamps_normalized) with the normalized timestamps of your datasets.
If this function returns True, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, no further action is required.
Remove Gaps:

If gaps are present, call remove_gaps_if_existing(original_data, time_data, imputation_function).
This function processes the data to handle gaps, either by imputation for small gaps or by marking large gaps.
Result:

The remove_gaps_if_existing function returns a tuple with the processed data, information about the gaps, and the length of the data post-processing.
Use this information as needed for further analysis or processing of your time series data.

### Notes
- It is crucial to ensure that the time data is properly normalized before using these functions.
- The choice of imputation function can significantly affect the quality of the data post-gap removal.
- Large gaps are handled differently from small gaps, with large gaps being marked distinctly, typically with a specified value (like 0 or -1).
- This process, as described, provides a robust method for handling gaps in time series data, ensuring data integrity for subsequent analyses.
