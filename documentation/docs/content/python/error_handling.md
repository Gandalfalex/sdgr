## Error Handling Overview

### Introduction

In our Django REST API, we employ a robust error handling mechanism that captures various exceptions, logs necessary details, and returns clear, informative responses to the client. This ensures that any issues encountered during API requests are communicated effectively and can be addressed accordingly.

### Custom Exception Handler

#### Role

Our custom exception handler overrides the default Django REST Framework (DRF) handler to provide tailored responses for different types of exceptions.

#### Functionality

- **Exception Mapping**: Specific exceptions are mapped to corresponding HTTP status codes.
- **Response Generation**: A `JsonResponse` is constructed with error details, including a message, a reason (if available), and an internationalization key (i18nKey) for localization support.
- **Logging**: Unknown errors are logged for further investigation.

### Defined Exceptions

1. **NotFoundException (404 Not Found)**: Triggered when a requested resource is not available.
2. **BadRequestException (400 Bad Request)**: Used for generic client errors, with additional details in the `reason` attribute.
3. **InvalidFileTypeException (400 Bad Request)**: Specific for file-related issues, indicating an unacceptable file type.
4. **UniqueConstraintViolationException (409 Conflict)**: Arises when a database unique constraint is violated.
5. **UserNotAuthenticated (403 Forbidden)**: Indicates a failure in user authentication.

### Exception Handling Process

1. **Exception Capture**: When an exception occurs, the custom handler checks if it matches any of the predefined exceptions.
2. **Response Construction**: If matched, a `JsonResponse` is constructed with relevant details.
3. **Fallback to DRF Handler**: If the exception is not matched, the default DRF handler is invoked for standard processing.
4. **Unknown Error Handling**: In case of an unhandled exception, a generic server error response is returned.

### Conclusion

This custom approach to error handling in our Django REST API enhances the clarity and relevance of error responses, aiding both in client-side debugging and server-side monitoring.
